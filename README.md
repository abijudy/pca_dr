## Overview
In this repository you will find a python implementation for an efficient intrusion detection system that uses Principal Component Analysis algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset across an IoMT environment.




## Disclaimer
This code has been published for research purposes only. It is our hope that with this code, others will be able to better understand cyber threats and find better ways to mitigate it.
